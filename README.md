# US-University--Analysis
 Predicting university enrollment &amp; graduation rates using student profile data (SAT, ethnicity, gender, cost) with EDA and data-driven insights.

# 🎓 U.S. University Admissions & Graduation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project addresses real-world challenges faced by American universities (outside the top 20) and prospective students. The analysis aims to help institutions make informed admission decisions while also guiding students to identify the most cost-effective and high-performing colleges.

We explore patterns in **enrollment and graduation rates** using student demographic and academic features, and identify **colleges that provide the best value** for students.

---

## 🧠 Business Problem

Universities need to:
- Maintain a strong **graduation rate** without diluting admission standards.
- Select students who are not only **academically suitable**, but **likely to enroll**.
- Predict performance of new batches based on **historical data**.

Students need to:
- Choose colleges that **maximize graduation success** while **minimizing cost**, based on their personal profiles.

---

## 🔍 Objectives

1. Predict the **likely enrollment rate** of admitted students.
2. Estimate the **graduation rate** based on incoming student profiles.
3. Identify **most lucrative colleges** for students in terms of pass rate vs cost.

## 📁 Dataset

- **File**: `universities_data.csv`
- **Features** include:
  - SAT/ACT scores
  - Ethnicity
  - Gender
  - Immigration status
  - Tuition and costs
  - Admission and enrollment stats
  - Graduation outcomes

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
  - `Pandas` – data wrangling and analysis
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – data visualization
  - `NumPy` – numerical operations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis
- **Scikit-learn** *(optional)* – model building (if used)

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values, irrelevant columns, and inconsistent data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized trends in enrollment, graduation rates, and tuition fees.
   - Compared student profile attributes with institutional outcomes.
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created meaningful variables to evaluate student performance and cost-benefit metrics.
4. **Insight Generation**
   - Provided actionable insights to institutions and students.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- High SAT/ACT scores alone do not guarantee higher graduation rates.
- Colleges with balanced tuition and strong support systems show better outcomes.
- Ethnicity and gender distribution can correlate with both enrollment likelihood and graduation performance.
- Certain affordable colleges consistently deliver high graduation rates, making them ideal for budget-conscious students.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This analysis offers data-backed insights to:
- **Universities**: Optimize admissions for higher graduation outcomes.
- **Students**: Choose the right college based on performance and affordability.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Incorporate machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
- Add interactive dashboards for dynamic exploration of institutional performance.
- Enrich dataset with post-graduation employment data (if available).
